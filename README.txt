BUILDING PREMAKE

 Until an official release is made you will need to use an existing
 Premake 3.x executable to generate the project files. Grab a binary
 or executable package from the project site at:

   http://premake.sourceforge.net/

 Then use it to create the project files for your particular toolset.

   $ cd premake-4.0
   $ premake --target vs2005   # For Visual Studio 2005 files

 Run `premake --help` for a complete list of supported toolsets.
