
check OutDir in debug it is showing "." --is this because no obj directory is supplied???
shared lib missing  <ImportLibrary>???</ImportLibrary> in link section when a static lib
	---I am confused at what the value should be
	--as explain by starkos this is to hide the lib in the obj directory which seems to
	--still be the valid thing to do with vs2010

add support for flags:  Managed, MFC, Unsafe
support C
support Managed C++
support C#

find why MFC in flags causes an error --pull the latest stable/vs2010 branch for MFC patch

No64BitChecks is removed after being deprciated in previous releases

fix ProgramDataBaseFileName tag currently at line 285 see note which states
				this can not be converted when using the upgrade tool
				added for now but it will removed or altered when I find out
				what is the correct thing to do.
				
 <ProgramDatabaseFile>$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).pdb</ProgramDatabaseFile>
 ----------Needs moving to link section for vs2010(dll checked- yet probably all)

 Hmm should the project define DEBUG and NDEBUG depending on if debugging info is on??
 should the project define _WINDOWS when using WinMain?
 
 
  <PropertyGroup Label="UserMacros" />
  <PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='???
   <EmbedManifest>false</EmbedManifest>
   
   
   
  <PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|Win32'" Label="Configuration">
    <ConfigurationType>DynamicLibrary</ConfigurationType>
    <UseDebugLibraries>false</UseDebugLibraries>--missing
    is this used when there are symbols
    	hmm profiling uses symbols does it not???
    
    
    currently the below format is not generated yet it uses the format from when
    a vs upgrade is done. change this
  <PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Debug|Win32'">
    <LinkIncremental>true</LinkIncremental>
    <IgnoreImportLibrary>false</IgnoreImportLibrary>
    <GenerateManifest>false</GenerateManifest>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <PropertyGroup Condition="'$(Configuration)|$(Platform)'=='Release|Win32'">
    <LinkIncremental>false</LinkIncremental>
  </PropertyGroup>
  
  dll
   <Link>
  <NoEntryPoint>true</NoEntryPoint>
   </Link>
