 Premake 4.4 fork for WinDirStat
=================================

About
-----
This is a friendly fork of `premake/premake-4.x
<https://github.com/premake/premake-4.x>`_.

I usually send pull requests to Jason, but I realize that not all of
my changes may be suitable or desirable. So I keep a separate branch.

Downloads
---------

I provide code-signed binaries in the `download area
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/windirstat/files/premake-stable/>`_ for the
benefit of those who don't want to build the binary themselves.

To get the latest code-signed build of ``premake4.exe`` simply
download from `this link
<https://sourceforge.net/projects/windirstat/files/premake-stable/>`_.

The ``.asc`` files corresponding to the ``.exe`` files which are named
something like ``premake4.rev-$rev-$commit.exe`` are the detached PGP
signatures. Please verify these or verify the signatures on the ``.exe``
using a tool like ``sigcheck.exe`` `from Microsoft
<https://live.sysinternals.com/sigcheck.exe>`_.

The version I build and provide is exclusively from the ``WDS-build``
branch, which should also be the one you get to see by default when
looking at this project in a browser.

License
-------
My changes are not substantial enough to claim any copyright. As far
as I am concerned any contributions that go into upstream are under
the license under which ``premake4`` was at the time of my
contribution and Jason Perkins has the copyright.
