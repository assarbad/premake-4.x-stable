=================================
 Premake 4.4 fork for WinDirStat
=================================
:Author: Oliver Schneider

About
-----
This is a friendly fork of `premake/premake-4.x
<https://bitbucket.org/premake/premake-4.x/>`_.

I usually send pull requests to Jason, but I realize that not all of
my changes may be suitable or desirable. So I keep a separate branch.

Downloads
---------

I provide code-signed binaries in the `download area
<https://bitbucket.org/windirstat/premake-stable/downloads>`_ for the
benefit of those who don't want to build the binary themselves.

The version I build and provide is exclusively from the ``WDS-build``
branch, which should also be the one you get to see by default when
looking at this project in a browser.

License
-------
My changes are not substantial enough to claim any copyright. As far
as I am concerned any contributions that go into upstream are under
the license under which ``premake4`` was at the time of my
contribution.
